Bakhoum1,2,*<br>~~~The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING)<br>~~~pathway has been primarily characterized as an inﬂammatory mechanism in<br>~~~higher eukaryotes in response to cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).<br>~~~Since its initial discovery, detailed mechanisms delineating the dynamic subcel-<br>~~~lular localization of its different components and downstream signaling have<br>~~~been uncovered, leading to attempts to harness its proinﬂammatory properties<br>~~~for therapeutic beneﬁt in cancer. Emerging evidence, however, indicates that<br>~~~a crucial primordial function of STING is to promote autophagy, and that down-<br>~~~stream interferon (IFN) signaling emerged recently in its evolutionary history.<br>~~~Furthermore, studies suggest that this pathway is a crucial regulator of cellular<br>~~~metabolism that potentially couples inﬂammation to nutrient availability. We<br>~~~focus on the evolutionarily conserved functions of STING, and we discuss how<br>~~~a broader understanding of this pathway can help us to better appreciate its<br>~~~potential role in cancer and harness it for therapeutic beneﬁt.<br>~~~The cGAS–STING Pathway: A Brief History<br>~~~The importance of cytosolic double-stranded (ds) nucleic acid signaling in higher eukaryotes has<br>~~~been the subject of renewed focus over the past two decades following the discovery of the<br>~~~cGAS–STING pathway (see Glossary) and the RIG-I pathway that sense and respond to<br>~~~cytosolic dsDNA and dsRNA, respectively [1–3]. Cytosolic dsDNA promotes a robust type I<br>~~~IFN response downstream of cGAS dsDNA sensing and the generation of the cyclic dinucleotide<br>~~~cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP) [4]. cGAMP subsequently activates the effector protein, STING, that<br>~~~promotes downstream inﬂammatory signaling deﬁned by the induction of interferon-stimulated<br>~~~genes (ISGs) [5,6]. Following its discovery in 2008, many studies centered on the proinﬂammatory<br>~~~nature of STING signaling and its regulation, focusing primarily on its role as an antiviral defense<br>~~~mechanism [7]. Later, the majority of studies in cancer research depicted STING activation as<br>~~~tumor-suppressive [8], which motivated the development of STING agonists. The rationale<br>~~~behind the development of STING agonists is to reactivate IFN signaling and antitumor immunity<br>~~~through direct STING engagement in the tumor microenvironment [9].<br>~~~Recent analysis of STING protein sequences, however, demonstrated that the IFN signaling-<br>~~~related function of this protein, that is mediated by its C-terminal tail (CTT), is a relatively recent<br>~~~addition, and that its conserved role is the induction of cellular autophagy in response to cytosolic<br>~~~dsDNA [10]. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of crosstalk between mammalian target of<br>~~~rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and the cGAS–STING pathway uncovered a crucial<br>~~~role for this signaling axis in insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver<br>~~~disease (NAFLD) [11–14]. Even the role of dsDNA as a sole activator of STING has been<br>~~~challenged by studies reporting that viral particle fusion with the plasma membrane is sufﬁcient<br>~~~to promote STING-dependent IFN signaling in a dsDNA- and cGAS-independent manner<br>~~~[15,16]. Similarly, in cancer, the tumor-suppressive role of cGAS–STING signaling has been<br>~~~challenged by evidence demonstrating that it can contribute to tumorigenesis as well as to cancer<br>~~~Highlights<br>~~~The cGAS–STING pathway is a crucial<br>~~~antiviral defense mechanism in mamma-<br>~~~lian cells.<br>~~~The role of cGAS–STING in cancer is<br>~~~complex because this pathway has<br>~~~been shown to exhibit both tumor-<br>~~~suppressive and tumor-promoting<br>~~~effects.<br>~~~Although STING was initially identiﬁed<br>~~~as a mediator of IFN signaling, recent<br>~~~studies have revealed that autophagy,<br>~~~and not IFN signaling, is a more highly<br>~~~conserved function in evolution.<br>~~~Mounting evidence suggests that STING<br>~~~signaling is complex and is dependent<br>~~~on interacting partners at the endoplas-<br>~~~mic reticulum (ER).<br>~~~Disruption of STING signaling impacts<br>~~~on ER stress and unfolded protein<br>~~~responses, NF-κB signaling, and cellular<br>~~~metabolism.<br>~~~The IFN-independent<br>~~~functions of<br>~~~STING explain its tumor-promoting<br>~~~and prometastatic effects.<br>~~~1Human Oncology and Pathogenesis<br>~~~Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering<br>~~~Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065,<br>~~~USA<br>~~~2Department of Radiation Oncology,<br>~~~Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer<br>~~~Center, New York, NY 10065, USA<br>~~~*Correspondence:<br>~~~samuel.bakhoum@gmail.com<br>~~~(S.F.

Therefore, the cellular and systemic functions of cGAS–<br>~~~STING signaling extend well beyond its role as an IFN-inducing pattern recognition receptor,<br>~~~and appear to be highly context-dependent.<br>~~~We discuss here the diverse roles of the cGAS–STING pathway, covering the spectrum of its<br>~~~evolutionarily conserved functions.

It is not surprising, therefore, that nucleic acid sensors are conserved across<br>~~~most forms of life. Multiple studies have explored the evolutionary origins and conservation of<br>~~~cGAS across the Kingdom of Life [19,20]. An enzyme called DncV in Vibrio cholera was shown<br>~~~to synthesize cyclic dinucleotide second messengers. In Escherichia coli, DncV can synthesize<br>~~~c-AMP-GMP and c-di-AMP [21]. Later, an enzyme synthesizing cUMP-AMP was characterized<br>~~~from E. coli and, because of<br>~~~its structural homology to DncV, it was termed DncV-like<br>~~~nucleotidyltransferase (encoded by cdnE) [22]. Interestingly, these early cGAS proteins in both<br>~~~E. coli and V. cholera activate phospholipase A2, resulting in pores in the inner membrane of<br>~~~bacteria and eventual cell death during bacteriophage infection, thus preventing the spread of<br>~~~infection to neighboring cells [23,24].<br>~~~Similarly to cGAS, bioinformatic analyses have identiﬁed candidate STING homologs in bacteria<br>~~~and diverse metazoans, and suggest that most homologs have a conserved ability to bind cyclic<br>~~~dinucleotides (CDNs) [25,26]. Recently, Morehouse et al. reported the presence of bacterial<br>~~~STING homologs that primarily occur as fusions to the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) adaptor<br>~~~domain [27]. The bacterial STING was also observed to drive oligomerization of TIR effector<br>~~~domains and rapid NAD+ cleavage during bacteriophage infection, enabling host survival. The<br>~~~best-characterized functional eukaryotic STING homolog was identiﬁed in the sea anemone,<br>~~~Nematostella vectensis (nvSTING). Interestingly, and despite only 29% sequence homology<br>~~~between nvSTING and human STING (hSTING), their 3D structures are superimposable. Both<br>~~~proteins crystallize in distinct open and closed conformations, revealing their dynamic nature.<br>~~~Further, nvSTING has a higher afﬁnity for 2′,3′ cGAMP than the bacterial 3′,3′ cGAMP, similarly<br>~~~to hSTING (<1 nM) [19,20,28].<br>~~~The recent evolutionary addition to STING, the CTT, is present in most vertebrates, but with some<br>~~~exceptions including amphibians such as Xenopus tropicalis and X. laevis [20,26]. The STING<br>~~~CTT is crucial for type I IFN induction and for the recruitment of TBK-1 and IRF-3. The STING<br>~~~protein in X. tropicalis and X. laevis is able to bind 2′-3′ cGAMP, as assayed by electrophoretic<br>~~~mobility shift assay, but its signaling function and role in immunity to viral infections remain to<br>~~~be tested. nvSTING, that also lacks the CTT, is unable to induce IFN-β; however, the chimeric<br>~~~STING produced by fusion with the human CTT produces low levels of IFN-β [19]. Therefore,<br>~~~the ability of STING to induce type I IFN signaling through IRF3 phosphorylation is an evolutionarily<br>~~~recent event.<br>~~~Despite its wide conservation, there is evidence that STING has also undergone evolutionary<br>~~~divergence within the animal kingdom. For instance, all Nematoda lack STING, and some<br>~~~insect STING proteins do not bind CDNs [26].

This type of evolutionary analysis might shed light on the<br>~~~essentiality of the various STING functions and potential redundancies with other nucleic<br>~~~acid sensors.<br>~~~dsDNA- and cGAS-Independent Activation of STING<br>~~~STING, also known as TMEM173, ERIS, MITA, or MPYS, was initially discovered as an endo-<br>~~~plasmic reticulum (ER)-resident sensor of CDNs with varying orders of afﬁnity [29–33]. It has<br>~~~four transmembrane helices that anchor it to the ER membrane, a cytoplasmic domain that<br>~~~binds the ligand, and the two domains are connected by a short linker [34,35]. Upon cGAMP<br>~~~binding, STING undergoes a conformational change that promotes higher-order oligomeriza-<br>~~~tion, followed by its transport via COPII vesicles from the ER via the ER–Golgi intermediate<br>~~~compartment (ERGIC) to the Golgi apparatus (GA), and ﬁnally to perinuclear microsomes<br>~~~where it recruits TBK1 and IKKα/β to induce proinﬂammatory transcriptional signaling [36].<br>~~~Although the cellular compartment where STING associates with TBK1 remains controversial,<br>~~~ranging between ERGIC and GA, the association of STING and TBK1 is crucial for its down-<br>~~~stream IFN signaling (Figure 1) [36–38]. Although the detailed stepwise mechanism for<br>~~~STING translocation is unknown, several effector proteins have been identiﬁed, namely the<br>~~~translocon proteins Trapβ, Sec61β, the transmembrane emp24 protein transport domain-<br>~~~containing 2 (TMED2), sorting nexin 8 (SNX8), inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2), the<br>~~~autophagy-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34, and the ubiquitin regulatory X<br>~~~domain-containing protein 3B (UBXN3B) [3,39–43]. iRhom2 recruits EIF3s5, a deubiquitination<br>~~~enzyme that is involved in removal of its K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, thereby maintaining<br>~~~its stability as well as mediating recruitment of Trapβ for its downstream translocation [40].<br>~~~SNX8 is crucial for the recruitment of VPS34 [42]. In addition, YIPF5, a member of the Yip family<br>~~~of proteins involved in ER–Golgi transport, was recently found to be crucial for STING transloca-<br>~~~tion COPII vesicles, through which STING is transported to multiple membrane compartments [44].<br>~~~Abrogation of COPII via deletion of SAR1A or SEC24 or downregulation of YIPF5 leads to defects in<br>~~~autophagy as well as in the IFN signaling function of STING [44]. Further, the STING ER exit protein<br>~~~(STEEP/CXORF56) has been identiﬁed to increase phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) pro-<br>~~~duction that is crucial for the ER membrane curvature that enables COPII-mediated exit [45].<br>~~~Thus, trafﬁcking of STING is dependent on the assembly of a complex machinery that governs<br>~~~its translocation from the ER, a crucial feature that regulates its multiple functions (Figure 1).<br>~~~Some studies have also highlighted that STING can be activated even in the absence of the ligand<br>~~~cGAMP (Box 1).<br>~~~Retention of STING in the ER requires binding to other ER proteins (Figure 2). In a recent study,<br>~~~Srikanth et al. reported that the Ca2+ sensor STIM1 interacts with, and is responsible for,<br>~~~STING retention in the ER. STIM1−/− THP1 cells exhibited increased STING dimerization and<br>~~~phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, resulting in the activation of type I IFNs and inﬂammatory<br>~~~cytokines [46]. It remains unclear whether STING activation in STIM1−/− cells requires cGAMP.<br>~~~However, the clinical features of patients with inactivating mutations in STIM1 are similar to<br>~~~those with STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), wherein mutant STING<br>~~~is constitutively active. In related work, it was found that Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) is also<br>~~~a crucial stabilizer of STING that retains it at the ER in ﬁbroblasts [47]. Destabilization of this inter-<br>~~~action led to enhanced lysosomal degradation of STING mediated by the ER stress-response<br>~~~regulator, IRE-1α. Thus, STING acts a versatile signaling hub to integrate multiple stimuli,<br>~~~highlighting the need to understand the distinct roles of its independent domains in its overall<br>~~~function.<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xx<br>~~~3<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences<br>~~~Figure 1. The cGAS–STING Signaling Cascade. Double-stranded (ds) DNA from multiple extracellular sources, such as bacteria, viruses, dying cells, and<br>~~~microvesicles (A), as well as intracellular sources such as mitochondria (B) and micronuclei generated from primary nucleus (C), is sensed by cGAS that synthesizes<br>~~~cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) (D). cGAMP activates STING, that is resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), via an interaction with proteins such as STIM and TOLLIP<br>~~~(E). Upon cGAMP binding, STING is transported via COPII vesicles (F) from the ER to the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (G) to the Golgi apparatus in a<br>~~~process that is dependent on SAR1, Sec24C, YIPF5, and ARF family members (H). STING is ﬁnally trafﬁcked to endosomes (I) where it also interacts with TBK1 and<br>~~~IRF3, culminating in type I interferon (IFN) production (J). From the ERGIC, STING also provides a double-membrane scaffold for the formation of autophagosomes<br>~~~formation (K) that ultimately fuse with lysosomes (L). In addition, bacterial c-di-AMP leads to ER stress, and this can initiate STING-mediated ERphagy (M) culminating<br>~~~in lysosomal fusion (N) as well as in type I IFN production (O).

STING<br>~~~trafﬁcking together with TBK1 into autophagosomes represents a crucial negative feedback mecha-<br>~~~nism that limits unchecked inﬂammation in response to cytosolic dsDNA [39,48,49]. Using STING<br>~~~orthologs from multiple organisms, Gui et al. demonstrated that transfection of dsDNA into BJ immor-<br>~~~talized ﬁbroblasts led to LC3 lipidation and the formation of double-membrane, LC3-II-bearing<br>~~~autophagosomes in addition to the widely reported IFN induction [10].

Ligand-Independent Noncanonical Functions of STING<br>~~~Although STING engagement by cGAMP is considered to be the canonical activation mechanism, emerging evidence<br>~~~suggests that STING can be activated in a cGAS- and cGAMP-independent manner. Binding of cationic liposomes or<br>~~~virus-like particles (VLPS) devoid of DNA to the plasma membrane can directly activate STING (see Figure 2 in main text)<br>~~~[15,16]. Thus, STING activation might confer cross-resistance to RNA viruses. Indeed, HEK293 cells transformed with HIV<br>~~~fusion protein ENV and cocultured with THP1 macrophages exhibited increased IFN production [15]. Furthermore, STING<br>~~~was found to be activated in a cGAS-independent manner upon infection by inﬂuenza A virus, an enveloped RNA virus<br>~~~[16]. This noncanonical mode of STING activation is mediated by a highly conserved arginine residue that is located away<br>~~~from the cGAMP-binding pocket, adjacent to the STING dimerization surface; the exact mechanism remains to be charac-<br>~~~terized [15]. Collectively, this supports the role of STING as a sensor of unscheduled membrane-fusion events. It is important<br>~~~to note that the magnitude of ISG induction in response to membrane fusion is signiﬁcantly lower than that seen during<br>~~~cGAMP-mediated STING activation, suggesting that addition of the CTT of STING might have been the result of an<br>~~~evolutionary pressure to maximize ISG induction in response to viral infection, especially in multicellular organisms that have<br>~~~adaptive cell-mediated immunity [15].<br>~~~STING can also function independently of cGAS in different protein complexes induced upon DNA damage by etoposide.<br>~~~IFI16, ATM, PARP-1, TP53, and TRAF6 form a complex that includes STING. TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination<br>~~~of STING leads predominantly to NF-κB activation rather than to type I IFN signaling. Further, the formation of perinuclear<br>~~~punctate structures, a hallmark of ligand-dependent activation of STING, was absent in this process [104].<br>~~~Naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations in STING have been found to promote ligand-independent activation,<br>~~~leading to diseases such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), familial chilblain lupus, or<br>~~~systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome [105–108]. Point mutations in STING in patients suffering from these<br>~~~diseases show a constitutive presence of STING in ERGIC and Golgi membranes. Although some constitutively active<br>~~~mutations are thought to mimic ligand binding, some have postulated that other mutations might also prevent interaction<br>~~~with unidentiﬁed proteins that are responsible for its retention within the ER [36,107]. In a related study, Melki et al. iden-<br>~~~tiﬁed three novel mutations on the surface of STING that lead to constitutive STING activation [108]. Therefore, it appears<br>~~~these two functions is likely one of the key milestones in the evolution of a complex and robust im-<br>~~~mune response in multicellular organisms. Interestingly, evidence for major histocompatibility<br>~~~complex (MHC) conservation extends to jawed ﬁsh species, and it is possible that the gain of the<br>~~~STING CTT coincided with the emergence of cell-mediated immunity ensuring robust antigen presen-<br>~~~tation [50].<br>~~~ERGIC membranes have been reported to be a membrane source for autophagosome formation,<br>~~~mediated by PI3 kinase and COPII signaling [51,52]. However, STING-mediated autophagy differs<br>~~~from conventional autophagy because it is independent of beclin 1, ULK1, and ULK2, but<br>~~~regulated by WIPI2 and ATG5. Furthermore, DNA degradation in these autophagosomes is crucial<br>~~~for reducing viral titers and for removal of cytosolic dsDNA following DNA damage [10,49]. This is<br>~~~supported by other studies showing that, although STING is not essential for rapamycin-<br>~~~dependent autophagy, it is required for cytosolic dsDNA-mediated autophagy [39]. It is possible<br>~~~that STING might have a more active and direct structural role in membrane trafﬁcking than merely<br>~~~being passively trafﬁcked as part of its regulation.

Further, in the presence of<br>~~~the STING agonist, DMXAA, hepatocytes and stellate cells incubated with wild-type BMDMs<br>~~~showed increased lipid accumulation and inﬂammation compared to their STING-knockout<br>~~~counterparts [13].<br>~~~Hasan et al. demonstrated a direct link between the master regulator mTORC1 and cGAS–<br>~~~STING signaling [59]. mTORC1 activation leads to inhibition of autophagy and lipolysis, and<br>~~~activation of anabolic processes and macromolecular biosynthesis [60]. In Trex1−/− mice, that<br>~~~exhibit an overactive cGAS–STING signaling axis because of the persistence of undigested<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xx<br>~~~7<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences<br>~~~cytosolic dsDNA, mTORC1 activity was found to be downregulated. The resulting increase in<br>~~~inﬂammation in Trex1−/− mice was restored upon loss of either STING or IRF3, but the metabolic<br>~~~changes were restored only in Trex1−/− STINGgt/gt mice, suggesting that some of the metabolic<br>~~~effects of STING might be independent of its downstream effectors such as IRF3, potentially<br>~~~suggesting that the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is involved [59]. Interestingly, pulldown of<br>~~~TBK1 revealed a physical interaction with mTORC1 and its substrates Raptor, 4EBP, and S6P<br>~~~only in TREX1−/− cells and not in their wild-type counterparts. In another study, TBK1 was<br>~~~found to inhibit mTORC1 activity via direct phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser877 [61]. In addition,<br>~~~pharmacological inhibition of TBK1 rescued the adverse inﬂammation seen upon loss of TREX1,<br>~~~and this has also been validated in prostate cancers where TBK1 was reported to inhibit<br>~~~mTORC1 activity [57,62].<br>~~~The role of STING in metabolic disorders cannot be solely attributed to its role in transcrip-<br>~~~tional<br>~~~inﬂammatory signaling, and emerging studies on its interactions, trafﬁcking, and<br>~~~crosstalk with different organelles suggest alternative mechanisms by which it might impact<br>~~~on cellular metabolism. Collectively, these ﬁndings establish a link between metabolism and<br>~~~STING.<br>~~~Role of STING in Ca2+ Homeostasis and the ER Stress Response<br>~~~STIM1, the ER Ca2+-sensor discussed above, is crucial not only for STING signaling but also for<br>~~~Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER, thereby regulating ER stress. Loss of STING or its translocation from<br>~~~the ER in response to cGAMP activation leads to depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, followed by STIM1<br>~~~movement and reﬁll of stores from extracellular Ca2+ via association with plasma-membrane<br>~~~sensor Orai1 [46]. In another study by Wu et al. it was observed that the N145S SAVI STING<br>~~~mutant led to disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis, causing ER stress in T cells and cell death upon<br>~~~T cell receptor (TCR) activation. The authors further identiﬁed the widely conserved domain of<br>~~~STING (amino acids 322–343) is responsible for modulating the unfolded protein response<br>~~~(UPR) independently of type I IFN induction. STIM1 overexpression reversed STING N145S-<br>~~~mediated ER stress and resulting cell death [63].<br>~~~In macrophages, cyclic-di-AMP secreted by Gram-negative bacteria is sensed by STING in the<br>~~~ER through an unknown mechanism. However, this process leads to ER stress and mTORC1<br>~~~inactivation, leading to the induction of canonical autophagy and ERphagy. Activation of ER<br>~~~stress responses in this setting prevents infection and results in cell death and IFN production<br>~~~by localization of STING on autophagosomal membranes, a dual edged strategy that protects<br>~~~the host from active bacterial infection [64]. Maintenance of ER homeostasis is crucial for protein<br>~~~synthesis, post-translational modiﬁcations, and vesicular trafﬁcking. The role of STING in the<br>~~~maintenance of these functions suggests bidirectional<br>~~~interplay between STING and ER-<br>~~~resident proteins that couple the ER stress response to inﬂammation and cellular metabolic<br>~~~regulation.<br>~~~The Role of the cGAS–STING Pathway in Cancer<br>~~~The well-documented role of type I IFN signaling in promoting proinﬂammatory immune inﬁltration<br>~~~has led to signiﬁcant interest in the potential role of cGAS–STING as a mediator of successful<br>~~~antitumor immunity [65]. However, emerging data suggest that, like its multifaceted role in normal<br>~~~cells, STING signaling in cancer supports diverse functions, some of which appear to be dichoto-<br>~~~mous unless taken in the proper context. A distinctive feature of cancer cells is chromosomal<br>~~~instability (CIN), deﬁned as an increased frequency of chromosome mis-segregation during<br>~~~mitosis [66]. This leads to generation of lagging chromosomes and aberrantly segregating<br>~~~chromosome fragments during anaphase, followed by the formation of micronuclei after mitotic<br>~~~8<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xx<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences<br>~~~exit. A conspicuous feature of micronuclei is their frequent rupture during S-phase that exposes<br>~~~the cytoplasm to genomic dsDNA [67]. Because cGAS recognizes both self and non-self dsDNA,<br>~~~this pathway is chronically activated in cancers in which CIN is rampant [1,17,68]. In addition to<br>~~~inherent CIN, radiation therapy and many DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents have been<br>~~~found to induce DNA damage and micronuclei formation, leading to cGAS–STING pathway<br>~~~activation and inﬂammation [69,70]. Another putative mechanism of DNA spillage into the cytosol<br>~~~is oxidative stress that promotes mtDNA leakage [11,71,72]. Notably, oxidized DNA is relatively<br>~~~more resistant to TREX1-mediated degradation and therefore it is a potent source of STING<br>~~~activation [73]. DNA has also been found in the cytosol of cells in the tumor microenvironment,<br>~~~such as phagocytic cells and endothelial cells, and is believed to have entered these cells when<br>~~~apoptotic tumor cells were engulfed [74,75]. How this DNA escapes from the phagosomes<br>~~~and into the cytosol is unknown.<br>~~~The expression of cGAS and STING varies greatly across human cancers. In an analysis of RNA-<br>~~~seq datasets for over 1000 cell lines of the Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Dou et al. revealed no<br>~~~correlation between STING mRNA levels and induction of ISGs; however, there was a strong<br>~~~correlation between its expression and the induction of other proinﬂammatory genes associated<br>~~~with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and this favors NF-κB as the<br>~~~predominant pathway downstream of STING in cancer [76]. A putative mechanism for IFN-less<br>~~~inﬂammatory signaling is via induction of the p38 pathway, which is activated in response to<br>~~~stress originating from DNA damage and chromosome mis-segregation and has been shown<br>~~~to selectively inhibit IFN signaling downstream of STING without impacting on NF-κB activity.<br>~~~Notably, p38 activates a STING-deubiquitinating enzyme, USP 21, that can modulate STING<br>~~~signaling output [77].<br>~~~In virtue of their persistent exposure to cytosolic dsDNA arising from CIN and mitochondrial<br>~~~dysfunction, tumors have also evolved to modulate the expression of cGAS–STING pathway<br>~~~genes so as to avoid its antitumor proinﬂammatory effect. However, this leads to chronic inﬂam-<br>~~~mation and immune inﬁltration, which can further promote tumor growth. Understanding the<br>~~~mechanisms by which tumors evade chronic cGAS–STING signaling might shed light on their<br>~~~evolutionary trajectory and offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention. For instance, loss of<br>~~~chromosome 9p, which harbors the IFN gene cluster, is a frequent event in colorectal and pan-<br>~~~creatic cancers [78]. Thus, tumors lacking 9p would be able to signal through NF-κB downstream<br>~~~of STING without eliciting an IFN response. Alternative mechanisms of immune evasion can<br>~~~involve the downregulation of STING levels, which was described in gastric and colorectal<br>~~~cancers as well as in advanced stage tumors [79,80]. However, a pan-cancer analysis<br>~~~of >10 000 samples from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database revealed that<br>~~~inactivating mutations and genomic loss of CGAS or STING occur in <1% of tumor types.<br>~~~Furthermore, many tumor types such as breast, head and neck, lung, and pancreatic cancers<br>~~~exhibit increased expression of CGAS and TMEM173 mRNAs compared to their normal tissue<br>~~~counterparts [81]. Thus, the majority of tumors appear to preserve cGAS and STING proteins<br>~~~and instead modulate downstream IFN signaling.<br>~~~Tumor-derived cGAMP can be exported from cancer cells and transferred to neighboring cells,<br>~~~resulting in direct activation of STING in the tumor microenvironment [82]. Recently, SLC19A1<br>~~~has been shown to be an importer of cGAMP from the extracellular milieu, and also of other<br>~~~CDNs with varying afﬁnities [83,84]. cGAMP can also be transferred through astrocyte–cancer<br>~~~cell gap junctions [85]. Further, connexins are reported to transfer cGAMP from epithelial cells<br>~~~to macrophages during viral infection, to bystander cells in cancer, and are upregulated in mela-<br>~~~noma cells upon bacterial infection [86–88]. Finally, dsDNA and cGAMP from tumor cells are also<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xx<br>~~~9<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences<br>~~~transferred to neighboring cells via exosomes where they activate the cGAS–STING signaling<br>~~~axis [89,90]. The transfer of dsDNA or cGAMP to non-tumor, bystander, and phagocytic cells<br>~~~has been shown to promote antitumor effects as well as facilitating tumor progression such as<br>~~~metastasis [91]. The conserved mechanisms of cGAMP transfer draw their roots to eukaryotic<br>~~~antiviral defense mechanisms that appear to be often hijacked, rather than suppressed, in<br>~~~advanced tumors.<br>~~~Tumor cGAMP is an important factor in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells. In melanoma and<br>~~~lymphoma mouse models, steady-state activation of cGAS in tumor cells, followed by paracrine<br>~~~cGAMP uptake by host NK cells, promotes type I IFN signaling leading to antitumor immunity [92].<br>~~~Earlier studies linking cGAS–STING activation in cancer to type I IFN led to the development of<br>~~~an array of STING agonists for anticancer therapy (Box 2) [93]. However, despite robust immuno-<br>~~~logical inﬁltration upon type I IFN production following agonist administration to mouse models,<br>~~~their efﬁcacy in humans has been limited either as single agents or in conjunction with immune<br>~~~checkpoint blockade [92,94–96]. This suggests that tumors have evolved mechanisms to<br>~~~dampen type I IFN signaling downstream of STING. Furthermore, in some instances, depletion<br>~~~of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), but not STING deletion, led to<br>~~~defects in CD8+ T cell priming, suggesting that the role of pattern recognition receptors in<br>~~~mediating antitumor immunity is a redundant process [97]. These observations, together with<br>~~~emerging evidence suggesting that chromosomally unstable tumors exhibit intrinsic resistance<br>~~~to cGAS–STING activation, complicate efforts to effectively target this pathway in cancer [98].<br>~~~STING and Cancer Metastasis<br>~~~The majority of cancer patients succumb to metastatic progression [91]. Many metastatic<br>~~~cancers exhibit increased CIN, and recent work by our group has revealed a link between CIN-<br>~~~induced chronic cGAS–STING activation and the ability of cancer cells to migrate and spread<br>~~~to distant organs. To elucidate the role of ongoing chromosome mis-segregation during metasta-<br>~~~tic progression, isogenic breast and lung cancer cells were generated that have varying rates of<br>~~~CIN [17]. This isogenic system of (CINhigh and CINlow) cells, which were equally aneuploid but<br>~~~Box 2. Targeting STING for Cancer Therapy<br>~~~The discovery that STING is a key mediator of the type I IFN response that enables a robust T cell response catapulted<br>~~~the development of STING agonists [109]. Because 2′,3′-cGAMP was found to have high afﬁnity for STING, the ﬁrst<br>~~~line of drugs synthesized to activate this pathway were hydrolyzable cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). DMXAA<br>~~~(5.6 dimethylxanthanone-4-acetic acid) is the most widely studied STING agonist [110,111]. It was found to be efﬁcacious<br>~~~in various combinations with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in mouse models of breast, prostate, and colorectal<br>~~~carcinoma, as well as melanoma [110,112,113]. Multiple human trials of the compound as a stand-alone intravenous drug,<br>~~~as well in combination with docetaxel, carboplatin, and paclitaxel have been conducted [114–117]. Several of these<br>~~~prematurely terminated owing to poor efﬁcacy and adverse events. However, detailed structural analysis recently revealed<br>~~~that DMXAA binds to mouse STING, but not to human STING, resolving the controversy regarding failure of this potent<br>~~~therapeutic [118,119]. Multiple STING agonists were since developed to overcome the deﬁciencies of DMXAA. E7766<br>~~~is currently in a Phase I trial as a standalone drug in multiple indications including solid tumors, lymphomas, and non-<br>~~~muscle invasive bladder cancer [120]. GSK3745417 is being tried as a standalone as well as in combination with the<br>~~~PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for advanced refractory/relapsed solid tumors and lymphomas [121,122]. ADU S-100<br>~~~(also known as MIW815) is currently being tested with multiple immunotherapy combinations such as with pembrolizumab<br>~~~for recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer, and with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) and PDR001 (anti-PD1<br>~~~antibody) for advanced metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas. Preliminary results have shown modest responses in<br>~~~refractory melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer [95,123–125]. Other STING agonists being investigated are<br>~~~SB11285 with nivolumab and BMS 986301 with ipilimumab and nivolumab [126–130]. However, the discovery of ENPP1<br>~~~(ectonucleotide nucleoside pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase) suggests that hydrolyzable CDN analogs face a threat<br>~~~of limited efﬁcacy in patients with higher expression of ENPP1 [131]. Therefore, the two recently discovered non-nucleotide<br>~~~analogs MSA-2 and SR-717 may hold greater promise [132,133]. Because prolonged activation of this pathway poses the<br>~~~threat of triggering chronic inﬂammation and metastasis, patient selection as well as the development of targeted delivery<br>~~~methods are likely to become quintessential for the success of STING agonists [17].<br>~~~10<br>~~~Trends in Biochemical Sciences, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xx<br>~~~Outstanding Questions<br>~~~Given the role of STING in multiple fun-<br>~~~damental cellular processes, including<br>~~~autophagy, ER stress, and the UPR,<br>~~~as well as in cellular metabolism, what<br>~~~is the central evolutionarily conserved<br>~~~role of STING?<br>~~~Did the IFN-related function of STING<br>~~~coevolve with an adaptive immune<br>~~~system?<br>~~~Can the IFN-independent functions of<br>~~~STING explain its dichotomous role in<br>~~~cancer?<br>~~~How does the signaling downstream<br>~~~of STING depend on the nature of<br>~~~pathway activation?

Instead, cells with high levels<br>~~~of CIN exhibited non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation, expression of mesenchymal traits,<br>~~~and an increased predilection for metastasis [17]. The role of cGAS–STING activation in promot-<br>~~~ing noncanonical NF-κB signaling has been reported before by Abe et al., and speciﬁc channeling<br>~~~of cGAS–STING signaling into noncanonical NF-κB production provides a direct link between<br>~~~genomic instability, inﬂammation, and metastasis [17,98,99].<br>~~~The mechanisms by which STING activates noncanonical NF-κB are poorly understood. It is<br>~~~possible that STING traverses through different compartments following association with TBK1,<br>~~~thus enabling differential induction of non-canonical NF-κB; indeed, knockdown of YIPF5 led<br>~~~to reduced TBK1 recruitment and downstream IFN-β production, but NF-κB signaling was<br>~~~not affected [44]. Notably, non-canonical NF-κB activation is independent of TBK1, suggesting<br>~~~that STING can signal through NIK, a key regulator of this alternative pathway. NIK activation is<br>~~~highly dependent on its stability, and it is plausible that STING might alter the stability or inter-<br>~~~nalization rates of plasma membrane-bound NIK inhibitors such as TRAF2/3 and c-IAP1/2<br>~~~[100]. A better understanding of how STING might inﬂuence NIK could offer an opportunity<br>~~~for therapeutic intervention to disrupt this metastasis-enabling signaling axis.<br>~~~A broader understanding of how cancer cells uncouple IFN signaling from NF-κB activation will be<br>~~~crucial for targeting adaptive mechanisms that are hijacked by tumor cells to spread to distant<br>~~~organs. To this end, K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING by mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein<br>~~~ligase 1 (MUL1) was shown to be essential for inducing an IFN response to cytosolic dsDNA<br>~~~[101]. This process was crucial for STING trafﬁcking, ER translocation, and IRF3 activation;<br>~~~however, it did not affect the NF-κB pathway. Interestingly, loss of K63-linked polyubiquitination<br>~~~did not impact on STING binding to cGAMP or on STING dimerization, raising a question regarding<br>~~~the widely reported crucial role STING trafﬁcking from the ER in the induction of NF-κB pathway, or<br>~~~if this is an upstream function of STING before its translocation from the ER [101].<br>~~~STING can also promote metastatic progression through paracrine signaling between cells in the<br>~~~tumor microenvironment (Figure 4) [102]. cGAS–STING activation in mesenchymal stem cells<br>~~~after exposure to ionizing radiation promotes the secretion of CCL5, leading to macrophage inﬁl-<br>~~~tration that promotes the formation of distant metastases [103]. Furthermore, GAP junctions<br>~~~formed by breast and lung cancer cells expressing protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), in association<br>~~~with connexin 43 in astrocytes, enable cGAMP transfer to astrocytes where STING activation<br>~~~promotes the secretion of TNF-α and IFN-α that enable the outgrowth of brain metastases<br>~~~[85]. The authors posit that paracrine signaling by these molecules activates NF-κB and STAT1<br>~~~signaling in cancer cells, thus promoting metastatic cancer cell survival in the brain, proliferation,<br>~~~and chemoresistance. GAP junction inhibitors, such as tonabersat and meclofenamate, inhibited<br>~~~brain metastasis in an immunocompetent mouse model [85]. Given that membrane-fusion events<br>~~~lead to STING activation, it is also possible that a surge in membrane fusion upon exosome shed-<br>~~~ding in cancer can in fact also lead to STING activation and promote metastasis [15].
